		<h2 id="ws">1. World Schools</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The world schools format is a debating format mostly reserved for pre-college level debates and/or for people just starting out, usually by adjusting the timings a bit.</p>
			<p>The structure is incredibly simple: there are two teams made out of three speakers each. The teams are playing on either side of the motion and their goals are to pass the motion, showing why it would be a good thing in a strong majority of the cases, or to show why the motion wouldn't work in a significant minority of the cases, respectively. The affirming team is usually called the <b>Government</b> team, whilst the negating one is the <b>Opposition</b> team.</p>
			<p>There are three constructive speeches and one "reply" speech for each of the teams. The constructive speeches are 8 minutes each, with the middle 6 minutes being open to POIs (short interventions from the other team), and the reply speech 4 minutes. Otherwise, the speaker can speak without any interruption.</p>
			<p>Constructive speeches must bring arguments, counter-arguments, definitions, examples etc, with the only caveat that the last speech cannot bring new content to the table. The order is as follows: Government speaker 1 -> Opposition speaker 1 -> Government speaker 2 -> ... -> Opposition speaker 3.</p>
			<p>Reply speeches have the purpose of summarizig the debate, trying to convince the jury/judge why that debate went in their favor (think of it as formal gaslighting). Speakers are not allowed under any circumstance to bring new content here. No interventions from the other team are allowed either. The Opposition team has the first reply speech, followed by the Government. The Reply speech is given by either of the first two speaker of a team.</p>

					<td>Speaker 1</td>

					<td>Bringing one or no arguments, counter-argumenting previous arguments, potentially re-supporting previous arguments from their team.</td>

					<td>Speaker 3</td>
					<td>Counter-argumenting, re-supporting previous arguments, shining light on the areas of conflict in the debate and analyzing them.</td>

					<td>Summarizing the debate, presenting the world of each side, telling why theirs is preferrable.</td>

		<h2 id="bp">2. British Parliamentary</h2>
		<div>
			<p>Honestly this format is a bit too complicated to explain right now but stay tuned for a followup. In a nutshell, it is made out of 4 teams of 2 speakers each. The teams are not in a FFA, though, as there are only two sides, and there are two sides per team.</p>
			<p>It's usually for college and post-college debates, meant to mimick, as the name implies, debates within the British Parliamentary <i>(woah!)</i>.</p>
		</div>

		<h2 id="other">3. Other formats</h2>
		<div>
			<p>There are many other formats, including MUN-type debates, where each speaker represents one country, and the whole debate is centered around a motion, where the countries must decide the course of action regarding it.</p>
			<p>There is also this Japanese format that came to Romania just this week, from a first glance it's a weird hybrid between WS and BP.</p>
